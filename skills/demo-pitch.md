# Skill: Demo + Pitch

## Goal
Deliver a crisp 3-minute demo that highlights product value, not just tech.

## 3-Minute Outline
1. Problem statement (30s)
2. Live workflow demo (90s)
3. Why it matters + results (45s)
4. What we'd build next (15s)

## Demo Script Prompts
- "Here's the moment the copilot saves the user 10 minutes."
- "We can go from question to action without context switching."

## Quick Wins
- Use 2 short, reliable prompts rather than long complex ones.
- Keep the demo flow linear and rehearsed.
