# Idea 1: AI Ranking for Countries

## Concept
Rank countries across the **eight layers of the AI industry** to reveal capability gaps and growth opportunities. The framework flows from **physical constraints** (power) to **economic impact** (implementation).

## The 8 Layers
1. Power & Electricity
2. Chipset Manufacturers
3. Cloud & Data Centers
4. Model Developers
5. Platform & Data
6. Applications & Startups
7. Education & Consulting
8. Implementation

## Deliverables
- Composite **AI Power Score** per country
- Layer-by-layer breakdown
- Interactive UI for comparisons

## Framework Details
See `ideas/NAAF-Research-Agents/assessment-framework.md` for definitions, metrics, sources, and weights.

## Next Steps
- Define 3–5 metrics per layer
- Decide weighting scheme (see scorecard)
- Identify data sources for each metric
