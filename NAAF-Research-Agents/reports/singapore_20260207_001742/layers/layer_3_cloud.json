  "justification": "Singapore is a global top-3 data center hub by attractiveness and the 4th largest in APAC by hyperscale capacity (~700-800 MW operational, 300 MW+ in pipeline). While cloud services are dominated by US/Chinese hyperscalers, Singapore maintains strong 'sovereign control' through domestic giants like STT GDC and Singtel (Nxera), and sophisticated government-managed cloud frameworks (GCC). Its score is capped slightly below 90 only by physical land/power constraints that limit absolute scale compared to the US or China.
