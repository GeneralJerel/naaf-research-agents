  "justification": "Singapore is a global benchmark for data openness, ranking tied for #1 in the Open Data Inventory (ODIN) 2024/25 with a score of 90/100 (Source: Open Data Watch). It also ranks #3 globally in the UN E-Government Survey 2024 (Source: United Nations). Internet penetration is near-total at ~96%, with 5.61M-5.79M users (Source: DataReportal). While absolute data volume is small due to the ~6M population, the data is highly structured and accessible via 'Smart Nation' initiatives, making it high-quality fuel for AI models. The score of 85 reflects elite data governance offset only by limited demographic scale.",
