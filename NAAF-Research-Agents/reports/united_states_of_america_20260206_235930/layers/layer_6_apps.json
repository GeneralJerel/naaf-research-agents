In 2024 alone, the U.S. minted **25 new AI unicorns**, accounting for 41% of all new U.S. unicorns that year (Morningstar/PR Newswire).\n- Total AI unicorn count in the U.S. is estimated between **150-200**, part of a broader 656-unicorn ecosystem that is the largest globally (World Population Review, 2024). \n- Major AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Databricks are U.S.-based, with OpenAI nearly doubling its valuation in 2024.\n\n**Sources**:\n- PitchBook, 'AI startups grabbed a third of global VC dollars in 2024': https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/ai-startups-grabbed-a-third-of-global-vc-dollars-in-2024\n- Crunchbase, 'Global venture funding reached $314B in 2024': https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-data-analysis-ai-eoy-2024/\n- CB Insights, 'State of AI Q3’24 Report': https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q3-2024/\n- World Population Review, 'Unicorns by Country 2025': https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/unicorns-by-country\n- Hurun Global Unicorn Index 2024/2025.",
