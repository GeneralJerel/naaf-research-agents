  "executive_summary": "The United States is the undisputed global AI Hegemon with an overall score of 96.20. It demonstrates absolute dominance across 6 of the 8 NAAF layers, including Cloud Infrastructure, Model Development, Startups, and Talent. The US holds a commanding 54% share of global hyperscale capacity and is the primary source of frontier models like GPT, Gemini, and Claude. Its venture capital ecosystem accounts for roughly 60-70% of global AI investment. While it leads in semiconductor design and equipment, its fabrication capacity (Layer 2) is a strategic vulnerability currently being addressed by the CHIPS Act. Additionally, its energy infrastructure (Layer 1), while massive, faces competitive pressure from China in terms of total capacity and pricing. Strategic recommendations include accelerating domestic leading-edge fabrication and modernizing the power grid to meet the surging electricity demands of AI data centers.",

It is the world leader in nuclear electricity generation, which accounts for 18.6% of its mix. Total carbon-free generation (nuclear + renewables) reached 40% in 2023. However, the U.S. trails China significantly in total volume and capacity. Industrial electricity prices are moderately competitive at $0.143 - $0.149/kWh (2024/2025), which is higher than China (~$0.09/kWh) or Saudi Arabia (~$0.07/kWh) but much lower than European averages.
