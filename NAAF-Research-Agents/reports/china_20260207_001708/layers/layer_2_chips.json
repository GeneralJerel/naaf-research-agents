  "justification": "China is a global powerhouse in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in mature nodes and critical minerals, though it faces significant hurdles in ultra-advanced nodes and lithography equipment.\n\n**Fabrication Capacity**:\n- China has successfully achieved mass production of **7nm chips** (SMIC N+2 node), used in the Huawei Mate 60 Pro and newer devices (Source: TechInsights, 2023-2024). \n- SMIC and other domestic players are reportedly moving toward **5nm production by 2025** using DUV multi-patterning, though at high cost and lower yields compared to TSMC (Source: TrendForce, Asia Times). \n- China leads the world in **mature node capacity (>28nm)**, accounting for a significant share of global output (Source: OECD, SEMI).\n\n**Equipment & Supply Chain**:\n- **Lithography**: China is developing domestic DUV tools. SMEE has produced 28nm-capable machines, and newer systems from Yuliangsheng/Huawei are in testing (Source: Tom's Hardware, TrendForce). However, it remains cut off from EUV technology required for <5nm efficiency.\n- **Etching & Deposition**: Self-sufficiency is rising rapidly, with domestic equipment rates projected to reach 50% by 2025 in sectors like etching, cleaning, and CMP (Source: TrendForce, 2025).\n- **Critical Minerals**: China exerts dominant control over the global supply of **gallium (80%+ share)**, **germanium (60%+ share)**, and **graphite**, having implemented export controls in 2023-2024 to leverage this advantage (Source: IEA, CSIS).\n\n**Scoring Justification**: \nChina receives a score of 80/100. While it lags behind the global leader (Taiwan/TSMC) in ultra-advanced nodes (<5nm) and the Netherlands (ASML) in lithography, its undisputed dominance in the mineral supply chain and its rapid progress toward 7nm/5nm self-sufficiency despite intense sanctions make it the clear #2 or #3 global player in this layer.\n\nSources:\n- TechInsights (SMIC 7nm): https://www.techinsights.com/blog/chinas-smic-plays-7-nm-card\n- TrendForce (5nm by 2025): https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/03/28/news-smic-reported-to-complete-5nm-chips-by-2025-but-costs-may-be-50-higher-than-tsmcs/\n- CSIS (Equipment & Sanctions): https://www.csis.org/analysis/chip-race-china-gives-huawei-steering-wheel-huaweis-new-smartphone-and-future\n- IEA (Critical Minerals): https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/executive-summary\n- OECD (Fab Capacity Mapping): https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-chip-landscape_02dbd028-en/full-report/component-6.html",
