  "justification": "China is the world's second-largest cloud and data center market, trailing only the United States. \n\n- **Compute Density**: As of 2024, China has approximately **31.7 GW** of installed data center capacity, ranking #2 globally (the US leads with 53.7 GW). Together, the US and China account for roughly 70% of global capacity (Source: Visual Capitalist, 2024). \n- **Hyperscale Presence**: China accounts for approximately **15% of global hyperscale capacity** (Source: Synergy Research Group). While the US holds a dominant 54% share of hyperscale capacity, China is the clear runner-up and home to major hyperscalers like Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei, and ByteDance.\n- **Sovereign Cloud & Domestic Dominance**: China has the world's most robust domestic cloud ecosystem. As of Q1 2025, the market is dominated by domestic providers: **Alibaba Cloud (33%)**, **Huawei Cloud (18%)**, and **Tencent Cloud (10%)** (Source: Canalys/Omdia). Foreign providers (AWS, Azure) are forced into local partnership models and hold minor market shares, ensuring high sovereign control.\n- **Infrastructure Strategy**: The national **'Eastern Data, Western Computing' (Dongshu Xisuan)** initiative has established 8 national computing hubs and 10 data center clusters to optimize energy and compute resources across the country. Total computing power in key hubs like Guizhou reached 57 EFLOPS by the end of 2024 (Source: SCMP/Gov.cn).\n\nChina receives a score of 90, reflecting its position as the only country with a cloud infrastructure scale and domestic self-sufficiency comparable to the United States.\n\nSources:\n- Visual Capitalist (Capacity 2024): https://www.visualcapitalist.com/data-center-capacity-around-the-world/\n- Canalys/Omdia (Cloud Market Share 2025): https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2025/jul/mainland-chinas-cloud-infrastructure-market-growth-accelerated-in-q1-2025\n- Synergy Research Group (Hyperscale): https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/the-worlds-total-data-center-capacity-is-shifting-rapidly-to-hyperscale-operators\n- China Gov (East-West Computing): https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202408/29/content_WS66d03a1ac6d0868f4e8ea539.html",
